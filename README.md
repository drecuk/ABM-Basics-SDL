# ABM-Basics-SDL
Agent-Based Modelling Chapter One: C++ integration with SDL

### Topic: Object-Oriented C++ integration with SDL and OpenGL for Agent-Based Modelling (ABM)
### Author: Eugene Ch'ng [Academic Blog](http://www.complexity.io/)
### Purpose: Prepared for the ERC Advanced Research Grant 'Lost Frontiers' Scalable Agent-Based Modelling Team Training.
### Audience: For students and researchers needing a quick approach to learning agent-based modelling foundation for C++ and OpenGL

## INTRODUCTION
The series of C++ code in this repository was created as a result of a need to equip team members working in the ERC 'Lost Frontiers' Advanced Research Grant with the basics of working with C++ codes, integrating both OpenGL 3.0 and SDL 2.0. As such, the code posited within each folder is designed to lead any developer with a basic understanding of C++ syntax towards the foundational knowledge of designing agent-based modelling codes, using SDL at first, continuing with the basic of OpenGL, and ending with the integration of OpenGL, SDL and Object-Oriented Programming in C++. 

The series of code will also be useful for developers and students intending to understand how to developed agent-based simulation, games, and etc with C++, SDL and OpenGL.

The series of code blocks within each folder are listed below. I suggest that beginners go through the sequence of code and avoid skipping folders for a more thorough understanding of how everything comes together into an ABM system.
